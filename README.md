## 📌 **About the Project**

This project recreates the Blackjack card game using Python’s **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.
It uses classes for `Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, and `Game` to simulate real gameplay including shuffling, dealing, hitting, standing, and checking for Blackjacks.

I built this project to practice OOP, game logic, and user interaction in the console.

* Dealer will reveal cards and hit until reaching at least 17.
* The winner is decided based on the final hand values.
